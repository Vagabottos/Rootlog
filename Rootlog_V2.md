# Rootlog

A unified notation system for tracking turn activity in the board game [Root](https://ledergames.com/products/root-a-game-of-woodland-might-and-right), produced by Leder Games inc.

## About

This is a WIP. Current version: V2.8 (updated 8 Nov 2021). Questions and Feedback are greatly appreciated.

This system is inspired in part by algebraic notation in Chess. It's also inspired by and heavily draws on Nevakanezah's original [Rootlog](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2543149/article/36304225) notation.

To handle different factions having very different moves and abilities, Rootlog eschews recording the names of each faction-specific action, and instead records the movement of game pieces incurred by those actions. This means that readers must employ some intuition to understand what happens and why during each turn.

## Goals

1. To track legal changes to board state.
2. To allow quick recording of actions by hand during a game.
3. To allow easy reading of actions, by both machines and humans.

Future changes will be evaluated based on whether they get Rootlog closer to these goals.

## Improvement Space

- Not all Draft systems may be included by this notation.
- There's no notation for Spy cards.
- Ministers do not yet have abbreviations (for example, `#duchessofmud` takes a bit long to write).

## General Syntax

### Brackets in Syntax

- `[X]` = optional, can be omitted, often has a default value
- `<X>` = required, but variable
- `X` = write as shown (i.e. an actual "X")

### Separating Actions and Turns

- In the syntax on this page, "current player" means the player who's currently taking their turn.
- `/` or `;` separates actions recorded within the same turn.
- Each turn must be on its own line.
- You may optionally add an empty line after each round (when everyone's taken a turn), to make the game more human-readable.
- Commentary can be put at the end of a line like this: `// [Commentary]`.

#### Start Turn

`<Faction>:`

This syntax is at the beginning of each line that represents a turn, not on its own line.  

#### End of Game

`Winner: <Factions...>`

### Game Setup (Standard and ADSET)

The following lines must be included at the beginning of the notation, in the order they're shown here.

`Map: <Map Name>`  
`Deck: <Deck Name>`  
`[Clearings: <Suit>1, <Suit>2... <Suit>12]` *This records the clearing suits. Omitted only on the Fall map.*  
`[Landmarks: <Landmark 1 Setup>[/Landmark 2 Setup]]` *Include only in ADSET if landmarks are used. If omitted, default setup is assumed (ferry for Lake, tower for Mountain)*  
`[Hirelings: <Hireling 1>, <Hireling 2>, <Hireling 3>[/Hireling Setup...]]` *Include only in ADSET if hirelings are used. Don't notate which player set them up.*  
`[Pool: <Faction 1>[Faction 2...]]` *Include only in ADSET or if players will Draft from a limited pool of factions.*  
`<Faction>: <Player Name>` *Repeat this line once for each player in draft order, if applicable. In ADSET, each player's "Setup" turn comes on the line immediately after this line.*

- `Map Name` = `Fall`, `Winter`, `Lake`, or `Mountain`
- `Deck Name` = `Standard` or `E&P`

Record faction setup steps using game notation. Notate faction setup as a "turn," so the first turn recorded can always be read as the setup.

#### Landmark Setup

`<Landmark>-><Clearing>`

Don't notate who placed the Landmark. It can be included in comments if desired.

##### Landmarks

- `treetop` = Elder Treetop
- `city` = Lost City

- `D` = Underground Duchy
- `P` = Corvid Conspiracy
- `H` = Lord of the Hundreds
- `K` = Keepers in Iron

### Hirelings

Hirelings can be used as Factions for notation. Do not notate who controls the hireling when moving its pieces. It's never a hireling's turn. A hireling's faction board is its card.

`h_<Hireling Type>[d]`

- `d` = If present, hireling is demoted. Can be omitted after the setup step.

#### Hireling Types

- `C` = Forest Patrol/Feline Physicians  *(have warriors)*
- `E` = Last Dynasty/Bluebird Nobles *(have warriors)*
- `A` = Spring Uprising/Rabbit Scouts *(have warriors, don't notate die)*

- `f` = ferry (Lake map only)

### Pieces

`[Faction]<piece type>[_<letter>]`

- `card name or abbreviation` = The name of the card (all lower case with no spaces) or the abbreviation of the card listed in the Card Name Abbreviations section below. Card names and abbreviations can both be used within the same game's notation. If omitted, it's assumed it doesn't matter.

**Card Examples:**  
`F#` *One Fox card.*

- `r` = Face-up ("refreshed")
- `e` = Face-down ("exhausted")

### Clearings

`<Number>`

- `Number` = 1-12, according to the Law of Rootbotics map diagrams.

### Optional Move and Reveal Notations

These aren't necessary, but you can use them for faster, clearer notation.

## Common Questions

**Q:** Are card activations (such as Partisans, Arbiter, or Ronin) notated?  
**A:** No; only changes to game state are notated. Notate the result of the effect activation, but not the activation itself. For instance, if a card is discarded when activated, notate that it's discarded. Feel free to add commentary (`//`) to include information that isn't notated.

**Q:** Why does `B#C->` mean that the Marquise discards a Bird card? Why can't I write `CB#->`?  
**A:** In the correct syntax (`B#C->`), `C` is a *Location*: the Marquise's Player Hand. The card *starts* in the Marquise's hand and *moves to* the discard pile. In `CB#->`, the `C` means nothing (since cards aren't faction pieces), and the Bird card moves from the draw pile to the discard pile, which is nonsense.

**Q:** How do I notate warriors moving to the Coffin Makers card?  
**A:** If the Coffin Makers card has been crafted and is still in play, when warriors are moved to the supply (for example, `3w9->`), they're assumed to move to the Coffin Makers card. No additional notation is made.

## Examples

### Example Actions

- `#->O` *The Riverfolk draw one card from the deck.*

- `#V->C` *The Vagabond gives one unspecified card to the Marquise, for example, in Swap Meet.*
